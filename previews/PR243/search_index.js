Alpine applies a two-stage approach to strengthen piecewise convex relaxations for mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLP) with multi-linear terms. In the first stage, Alpine exploits Constraint Programing techniques to contract the variable bounds. Further, it applies optimality-based bound tightening (OBBT) methods iteratively until a fixed point with respect to the bounds are achieved. In the second stage, Alpine partitions the variable domains using an adaptive multivariate partitioning scheme (a parametrized partition at the current solution of sequentially solved MILPs), leading to sparser but tighter relaxations. This approach decouples the number of partitions from the size of the variable domains, leading to a significant reduction in computation time, and limits the number of binary variables that are introduced by the partitioning. Alpine also applies polyhedral cutting plane methods to handle convex relaxations of higher-order monomial terms.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Allowable nonlinearities: Alpine can currently handle MINLPs with polynomials in constraints and/or in the objective.
