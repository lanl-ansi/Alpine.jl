ALPINE (glob(AL) o(P)timization for mixed-(I)nteger programs with (N)onlinear (E)quations), is a novel global optimization solver that uses an adaptive, piecewise convexification scheme and constraint programming methods to solve non-convex Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programs (MINLPs) efficiently. MINLPs are typically "hard" optimization problems which appear in numerous applications (see [MINLPLib.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/MINLPLib.jl)). 

Alpine is entirely built upon [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) and [MathOptInterface](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl) in Julia, which provides incredible flexibility for usage and further development.

Alpine globally solves a given MINLP by:

* Analyzing the problem's expressions (objective & constraints) and applies appropriate convex relaxations and polyhedral outer-approximations

* Performing sequential optimization-based bound tightening (OBBT) and an iterative MIP-based adaptive partitioning scheme via piecewise polyhedral relaxations with a guarantee of global convergence

## Installation

Install Alpine using the Julia package manager:

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("Alpine")
```

## Use with JuMP

Use Alpine with JuMP as follows:

```julia
using JuMP, Alpine, Ipopt, HiGHS
ipopt = optimizer_with_attributes(Ipopt.Optimizer, "print_level" => 0)
highs = optimizer_with_attributes(HiGHS.Optimizer, "output_flag" => false)
model = Model(
    optimizer_with_attributes(
        Juniper.Optimizer,
        "nlp_solver" => ipopt,
        "mip_solver" => highs,
    ),
)
```

## Documentation

For more details, see the [online documentation](https://lanl-ansi.github.io/Alpine.jl/latest/).

## Support problem types

Alpine can currently handle MINLPs with polynomials in constraints and/or in the objective. Currently, there is no support for exponential cones and Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) cones in MINLPs. Alpine is also a good fit for subsets of the MINLP family, e.g., Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs (MIQCQPs), Non-Linear Programs (NLPs), etc.

For more details, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwkhiEIS5JA) on Alpine.jl at [JuMP-dev 2018](http://www.juliaopt.org/meetings/bordeaux2018/).

## Underlying solvers

Though the MIP-based bounding algorithm implemented in Alpine is quite involved, most of the computational bottleneck arises in the underlying MIP solvers. Since every iteration of Alpine solves an MIP sub-problem, which is typically a convex MILP/MIQCQP, Alpine's run time heavily depends on the run-time of these solvers. For the best performance of Alpine, we recommend using the commercial solver [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com), which is available [free](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/) for academic purposes. However, due to the flexibility offered by [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl), the following MIP and NLP solvers are supported in Alpine:
