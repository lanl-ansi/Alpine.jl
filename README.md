"ALPINE: glob(AL) o(P)timization for mixed-(I)nteger programs with (N)onlinear (E)quations", formerly **POD.jl**, is a novel global optimization solver that uses an adaptive convexification scheme and constraints programming methods to solve Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programs (non-convex MINLPs) efficiently. MINLPs are famously known as the "hard" programming problems that exist in many applications (see this [MINLPLibJuMP.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/MINLPLibJuMP.jl) for problem instances). Alpine is also a good fit for subsets of the MINLP family, e.g., Mixed-Integer Quadradic Convex Programming (MIQCP), Non-Linear Programming (NLP), etc.

Unlike many other state-of-the-art MINLP solvers, Alpine is entirely built upon [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) and [MathProgBase](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathProgBase.jl) Interface in Julia, which provides incredible flexibility for usage and further development.

Alpine globally solves a given MINLP by:

* Analyzing the problem's expressions (objective & constraints) and applies approporite convex relaxations

* Performing novel adaptive/dynamic partitioning methods to create piecewise relaxations, bound tightening and polyhedral outer-approximations to guarantee global convergence

## Installation

Alpine is currently a unregistered package, with it's repository under the LANL-ANSI group, which can be installed through the Julia package manager:

`Pkg.clone("https://github.com/lanl-ansi/Alpine.git")`

Developers: Any further development of Alpine can be conducted on a new branch or a forked repo.

## Underlying solvers

Though the algorithm implemented in Alpine is quite involved, most of the hard work and computational bottleneck would arise in the underlying solvers. Since every iteration of Alpine solves a subproblem to optimality, which is typically a convex MILP/MIQCQP and solves a nonconvex NLP/MINLP to local optimality, Alpine's run time heavily depends on the quality of these solvers. For best performance of Alpine, use commercial solvers such as CPLEX/Gurobi. However, due to the flexibility offered by JuMP/MathProgBase, the following solvers are supported in Alpine:
