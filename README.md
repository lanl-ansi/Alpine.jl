"Polyhedral Outer-Approximation and dynamic Discretization (POD)" is a novel global optimization algorithm that uses an adaptive convexification scheme and constraints programming methods to solve Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming problems (MINLPs) efficiently. MINLPs are famously known as the "hard" programming problems that exist in many applications (see this [MINLPLibJuMP.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/MINLPLibJuMP.jl) for problem instances). POD is also a good fit for subsets of the MINLP family, e.g., Mixed-Integer Quadradic Convex Programming (MIQCP), Non-Linear Programming (NLP), etc.

Unlike many other state-of-the-art MINLP solvers, POD is entirely built upon [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) and [MathProgBase](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathProgBase.jl) Interface in Julia, which provides incredible flexibility for usage and further development.

POD.jl solves MINLP by:

* analyzing the problem expressions (objective & constraints) to obtain a convexifyable formulation

* performing bound tightening to contract variables' feasible domains

* performing adaptive partitioning-based convexification to improve problem bounds for global convergence


## Installation

Currently, POD.jl is a private repository that is used by the LANL-ANSI group, the proposed publication is unknown given the upcoming changes in JuMP and MathProgBase that POD needs to adapt to. To install POD,

`Pkg.clone("https://github.com/lanl-ansi/POD.git")`

For developers, it is highly recommended that any further development on POD.jl is conducted on a new branch or a forked repo.

## Usage
For more details of the POD.jl usage instruction, please consult with [documentation](https://lanl-ansi.github.io/POD.jl/latest/)

## Important Note
POD.jl is a developing software and a developing research project in Los Alamos National Lab. It is not yet numerically robust and may require dedicated attention when encountering new instances. We embrace any issue and contribution to make this open-source solver better. If you are in need of help, please contact us or post an issue.
