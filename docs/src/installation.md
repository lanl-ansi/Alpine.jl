```@meta
CurrentModule = Alpine

Currently, AMP is a private repository that is used by LANL-ANSI group, the proposed publication is unknown given the upcoming changes in JuMP and MathProgBase that AMP needs to adapt to. To install AMP,

`Pkg.clone("https://github.com/lanl-ansi/Alpine.git")`

For developers, it is highly recommend that any further development on Alpine is conducted on a new branch or a forked repo.
