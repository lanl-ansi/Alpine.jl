# Usage

## Building a problem
For simplicity, we present a simple nonlinear program without any discrete variable for demonstration. The model is implemented in JuMP format. Two opon-source sub-solvers, [Ipopt](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Ipopt.jl) and [Cbc](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Cbc.jl), are used to handle local NLP (`nlp_local_solver`) and relaxed MIP (`mip_solver`). We control POD.jl to provide basic solving log through `log_level`. Before you solve, make sure that the two sub-solvers are properly installed and built.

```
using JuMP, POD
using Ipopt, Cbc

m = Model(solver=PODSolver(nlp_local_solver = IpoptSolver(print_level=0),
                           mip_solver = CbcSolver(logLevel=0),
                           rel_gap = 0.001,
                           log_level = 1))

@variable(m, x[1:8])

setlowerbound(x[1], 100)
setlowerbound(x[2], 1000)
setlowerbound(x[3], 1000)
setlowerbound(x[4], 10)
setlowerbound(x[5], 10)
setlowerbound(x[6], 10)
setlowerbound(x[7], 10)
setlowerbound(x[8], 10)

setupperbound(x[1], 10000)
setupperbound(x[2], 10000)
setupperbound(x[3], 10000)
setupperbound(x[4], 1000)
setupperbound(x[5], 1000)
setupperbound(x[6], 1000)
setupperbound(x[7], 1000)
setupperbound(x[8], 1000)

@constraint(m, 0.0025*(x[4]+x[6]) <= 1)
@constraint(m, 0.0025*(x[5]-x[4]+x[7]) <= 1)
@constraint(m, 0.01(x[8]-x[5]) <= 1)
@NLconstraint(m, 100*x[1] - x[1]*x[6] + 833.33252*x[4] <= 83333.333)
@NLconstraint(m, x[2]*x[4] - x[2]*x[7] - 1250*x[4] + 1250*x[5] <= 0)
@NLconstraint(m, x[3]*x[5] - x[3]*x[8] - 2500*x[5] + 1250000 <= 0)

@objective(m, Min, x[1]+x[2]+x[3])

solve(m)
```

## Interpreting POD log

POD.jl will output the log below. The output contains two main sections: 1) basic problem dimension and solver configuration summaries, and 2)presolve and main algorithms process. In the latter, The first two columns `NLP` and `MIP` are local solves and realxation solve objective value. Column `Objective` and `Bound` tracks the incumbent upper and lower bound of the problem. Without the loss of generality, upper bound is always defined through a feasible solution. Column `GAP%` is relative optimality gap evaluated through,

```math
    \textbf{Gap%} = \frac{|UB-LB|}{Ïµ+|UB|} \times 100\%
```

Total wall time performance is tracked through column `CLOCK`. Last but not least, the iteration is tracked incrementally in column `Iter`.
