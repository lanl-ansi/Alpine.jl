# Choosing Sub-Solvers

The design of the POD.jl requires a variety of programming problems to be solved underneath the surface.
More importantly, the potential of POD.jl is best exploited when utilizing strong sub-solvers. The performance of the example
shown in [Usage](@ref) is approximately 1/10 if MIP solver is Gurobi rather than Cbc.
POD.jl will customize the algorithm when utilizing different sub-solver. For example, POD.jl will utilize
tune starting values for MIP sub-solver and resolve infeasibility with local NLP/MINLP solvers.
For best algorithmic performance, it's recommend that dedicated solvers to be used for these operations.
Currently, the following sub-solvers with Julia Interface is partially supported by POD.jl:

| Solver                                                                         | Julia Package                                                |  Target Program   |
